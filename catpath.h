# Description

catpath.h provides a very simple, memory leak-free and easy interface for concatenate paths in C.

They are plenty of other path concatenate libraries, but they (all that I'v seen) have memory leaks,
like double malloc's and sometimes they dont have the easiest user interface.

So, I decided to create my own library, in the form of a single-file C header library, that is also
in the public domain.

catpath.h is designed for ease of use, and easy to include in your project; no other license file,
no other source files, no change to your CFLAGS, and no third-party dependencies. Just one file.


# How to use

Define this:
  #define CATPATH_IMPLEMENTATION

before including this header file in **one** of your C source
files to create the implementation. Like:

  #define <stdio.h>
  #define ...
  #define CATPATH_IMPLEMENTATION
  #define "catpath.h"
  #define ...


# API

See the beginning of the header (where the function prototype start).


# CHANGELOG

### v1.0.0 - 2021-01-06 (yet to be released)
 - Init release.

int catpath(char** path, const char* file);
/*
catpath will take a dereference pointer, and a file/path (which must be non-null). If path
is null (which it must be when creating a new path), then it will return a new allocated
pointer. If path is non-null (like if your adding another dir/file), then it will be freed,
and re-alloced for the correct new size. It is your responsibility to `free()` the path pointer
when you are done with it.

Special notes:
 - When creating the first path, you MUST init the char pointer with NULL, see the example.
 - Make sure to call `free()` to the char pointer when you are done with it.
 - The file argument must be null-terminated.

Example:

  int main() {
    char* some_path = NULL; // You must init the first path with NULL!

    // Create a new allocated pointer for `some_path` with contents of: `/starts/with/slash-and-end-with-slash` (removes the suffix '/')
    catpath(&some_path, "/starts/with/slash-and-end-with-slash/");

    // Append a path to `some_path`, will automatically free/alloc a new pointer and return it
    catpath(&some_path, "/other/path");

    // some_path contents: /starts/with/slash-and-end-with-slash/other/path

    // When you are done, make sure you `free()` the path.
    free(some_path);

    return 0;
